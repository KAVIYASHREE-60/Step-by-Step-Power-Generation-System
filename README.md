## 🧠 Working Principle

1. When a person steps on the piezo sensor, it produces a voltage due to mechanical pressure.
2. This voltage is directly connected to the analog input of the Arduino.
3. The Arduino reads the voltage value from the sensor.
4. Initially, the LCD displays your name (e.g., "Welcome Kaviya").
5. After a delay, the LCD displays the actual voltage sensed from the footstep.
6. An LED glows to indicate pressure has been applied on the sensor.
